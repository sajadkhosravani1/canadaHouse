    <p class="lead mt-5">The purpose in this project is digging out raw data of selling houses from this site.
        Then insert them into our local database and visualize them into our django-base website.
        And finally we are going to implement a learner agent that estimates price of houses by their features.
        By the way this project is going to be developed only for fun and learning purpose. Thanks to dear
